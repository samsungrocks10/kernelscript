# Scripts to build the Linux kernel
The normal script is meant to be used with tar.xz files from https://kernel.org

The git version of the script is meant to be used for linux-next git versions from https://kernel.org

<br/>

## Usage:
Run the script as non-root and input the tar.xz link or next-linux version, after the build process has finished, it will ask if you want to install the deb files.



**Note:** Root can be used but isn't required
